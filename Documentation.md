# Documentation of the >DEBUG MODE< (WIP)
TODO: Check if "Meme gaster" call thingy is debug exclusive (I think so)

Tab - Displays general stats

F1 or ] - Opens console

K - Shows object's names and ID

# Console
The next section will be explaining how to mess with the console, since anyone didn't documentated this and I had to figure most of it out by testing and looking in the code

# Commands
* create
* set
* destroy
* view
* script
* game
* console
* undertale

# Usage

<usage>: create [obj]

Examples:
